Here's what happened. This thing wz rockin and rollin for a couple of years back in the late oughts. Then maybe somebody adopted a little baby and time wz scarce. Happens. But then one time in 2014 someone got all "Aw yeah - that thing! Let's do that again!" And wouldn't you know the first one back was The Boss' ["Queen of the Supermarket"](/spatialtrack/spatialtrack/2014/10/18/spatial-track-bruce-springsteen-queen-of-the-supermarket/) and the track wz so overbaked and dumb that this thing suicided itself again.

Smashcut to: someone grew intrigued with the idea of loosely coupling [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and this blog wz once again just a tick north of pointless. 

So here we are in Spring 2016, starting again with Dengue Fever's ["Sober Driver,"](https://open.spotify.com/track/1t2RFopfoNz3a1O3RHRDXE) a maybe surprisingly moody, deceptively call-and-response middler from 2008's [Venus on Earth](https://open.spotify.com/album/0eILBBSXbyk9wYtKAITNJA). It's not outwardly Los Angelino in the same way as...uh, The Hollywood Vampires?...but when Chhom Nimol coos "Hey, where am I?" and the answer from some rando is "Echo Park" and that muted guitar plays over it all, you'll feel the lost late-nightness of it and Echo Park's a good choice for it. And guess what - we never do learn whether her weary ride – for whom she has become a thorn in the side that's "withered, dull, and dry" – ever even shows up. And no Uber back then, too, [clicking mouth sound like "too bad"].
