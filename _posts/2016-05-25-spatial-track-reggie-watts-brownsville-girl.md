Here's a whole other reason to resurrect this blog: Reggie Watts wasn't famous enough to make it in here (i.e. this thing wasn't hip and/or aware enough) cwhen this thing first started. But now, thanks at least in part to the [best thing on earth](http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/), he has ended up [blowing](http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/03/listen-reggie-watts-covers-bob-dylans-brownsville-girl/) [everybody's](http://www.spin.com/2014/03/reggie-watts-cover-bob-dylan-brownsville-girl-stream/) [minds](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2014/03/11/no-joke-reggie-watts-covers-bob-dylans-brownsville-girl) with a cover of Bob Dylan's [Knocked Out Loaded](https://open.spotify.com/album/0BoT4M1d5H6VJr3QUjsJma) (1986) [track](https://open.spotify.com/track/74KpujtKzOfwEXSfuPwfHq).[^1]

But first things first - the Dylan track. Lotta track to lay, so [lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dylan+%2B%22brownsville+girl%22). So the OG is beloved, but...c'mon...it's shitty, right? It's a rap about Gregory Peck...movies. By *Bob Dylan.* For fuxk's sake. Granted, it's probably the only song in history to reference *The Corpus Christi Tribune,* but still - sheesh.

But it's [generally believed to be/probably is](http://www.songplaces.com/Brownsville_Girl/Brownsville_Texas) about Brownsville, TX. Which is right next to (in Texas units) from <span data-target="rando" data-id="-99.5057715,27.5020404">Laredo</span> (friend of the blog). In true border form, let's fuse some dancehall swag and swing with that old, dusty epic and choose Reggie Watts' fun cover that not only does us the favor of chopping out 8 minutes, but also de-Dylanizes it with a kinda airy soul vocal. Could be that it's really-good-for-someone-who-usually-is-really-good-cuzza-a-preternatural-ability-with-his-pedal-stack or it could be legit good. Either way it's better than Dylan's![^2]

# MAPPING IT
About as south in Texas as you'll ever wanna be. Then 160 more miles <span class="trigger" data-target="milleria" data-id="gD21">is Brownsville</span> ;-)

[^1]: Full disclosure - this thing and [that thing](http://trainertothestarsseekingstars.org) (a fansite but with a twist) share a developer.
[^2]: You won't won't find a bigger Dylan fan for miles around Milleria headquarters, but there are limits and that limit is a bed of super reverby rim shots and gospel hums under this answer to the question "How far are y'all goin?":

Thank you, Reggie.
