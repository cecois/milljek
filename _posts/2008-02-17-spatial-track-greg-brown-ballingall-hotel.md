This one has everything you expect from a dirty, Greg Brown crawler: 
* marital infidelity
* sorrow and/or disappointment and/or fishing
* one or more dirty hotels
* low, low baritone
* local references
* lack of appreciable melody
* time travel
* Bo Ramsey

So there's not really that much more to s-- woa, woa, woa - stop the clock. That bullet says *time travel*. Here's why: near the end of this dingy, lugubrious tryst, Brown says:
<div class="lyrics"><br />
One night I knocked on the wrong door<br />
One night I knocked on the wrong door<br />
and myself as an old man answered - so drunk and so poor.<br />
<br />
I said I'd never come again to this ugly old hotel -<br />
but what the hell.</em></div>

See? Time travel. Kind of a nice twist, but time travel just the same, which WILL NOT BE COUNTENANCED here at Milleria!

Established. But Brown is from good ol' Iowa City, so he sets a lot of his sad regretscapes in the ratty, decaying small towns of Eastern Iowa. And it turns out the Ballingall is legit; is, in every likelihood, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34086110@N06/4498258908/">this one</a> (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34086110@N06/4497624499/">postcard view</a>) in Ottumwa, Iowa. Fair to assume it had perhaps atrophied a little by Brown's time, as <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7tAgAuOGN3oC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=ottumwa+%22ballingall+hotel%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=grHuf-e9bo&amp;sig=mSvvDmn823MjPLT5pfKaDOaRA2A">this account</a> briefly timelines why it was razed in 1996.

# MAPPING IT
[Off you go to Ottumwa, Iowa](http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=41.016234%2C-92.410389#map=19/41.01623/-92.41039), storied in poem and song. This one, anyway.
