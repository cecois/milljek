<p>Such restraint, I have! Last year, <a href="http://www.tompkinssq.com/">Tompkins Square Records</a> released <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/People-Take-Warning-Disaster-1913-1938/dp/B000ULQV20">People Take Warning! Murder Ballads &amp; Songs of Disaster 1913-1938</a></em>, and it's...brutally great, actually. In fact, I'm going to have to try hard to not just post song after song from this collection pulled together by Christopher King and Hank Sapoznik, who had strong enough radar to recruit Tom Waits to write an introduction.</p>
<p>The premise of this collection has been pretty well covered, and I think I first heard about it on <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/soundcheck/episodes/2008/03/21">Soundcheck</a>. It's attractive for many reasons, not least of which is that it promised the juxtaposition of really good stuff with really atrocious, spun-from-the-minds-of-opportunists-and-or-moralists dreck.</p>
<p>Oh, and here we are starting with the dreck: Bob Miller's "Ohio Prison Fire," a way, way overwrought -- but nonetheless jaunty! -- take on what was evidently a <a href="http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Ohio_Penitentiary_Fire">gruesome scene back there in Ohio</a>. Replete with a weepy, spoken melodrama piece in the middle, of course. Those "poor, charred bodies," she says. "Bodies, bodies, bodies!!" She can't stand it, she says, but nonetheless also can't seem to shut up about them. Methinks she doth protest too much, tbh.</p>
<p>But I digress! Here we have a cautionary (?) folk tale by one "Bob Miller" about an historic penitentiary fire and it's pretty easy to position it at the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=39.96743&lon=-83.0082&zoom=17&layers=M">Burnham Square Condominiums in Columbus, OH</a>. Condos, right? Of course! As in guess-what-yuppie-your-French-Press-coffee-maker-just-leaked-Kenyan-bean-juice-all-over-the-charred-bones-of-a-once-proud-pre-maybe-post-industrial-rapist (depending on age).</p>
<p>Actually, the bones are there either way, so what the fuck is a little yuppie coffee bean juice going to harm anything, y?</p>
