<p>Omg we get it -- John Bonham recorded his break for "When the Levee Breaks" in a closet or something. Enough! Let's not forget they were basically grafting super talented rock skills on top of stolen blues songs, k? How hard is that, really, if you already have killer rock instincts? Come on.</p>
<p>But if you like levees breaking, you're going to love the very arguable "original" "When the Levee Breaks," by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy. I guess Montana Mike and Spokane Sally couldn't find the studio that day. You're also going to love that Hurricane Katrina madness, I suppose, wherein the government and its contractors all responded one way, and thanks to a rising social media movement the people <a href="http://gregstoll.dyndns.org/scipionus/">responded differently</a>.</p>
<p>Anywho, I'm dropping the Memphis/Kansas "Levee" in Walls, Mississippi, which, according to Robert Santelli's <em>The Big Book of Blues</em> (Penguin Books, New York, NY, 1993), was Minnie's teen-years home and informed this track more than anything else might have (including, I suppose, the flood that ransacked the poorest regions of Jimme Page's boyhood homeland. Oh, that didn't happen? Got it.)</p>
