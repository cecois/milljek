Seems a little like ol' Ray Davies buried the leed in "Holloway Jail." It's ostensibly about <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/holloway">HM Prison Holloway</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Holloway">Wikipedia</a>), right? Which still exists in London and has in various iterations since 1852. And, okay, you've got a lady there, have you?

<div class="lyrics">They took my baby to Holloway jail.<br />
They took my baby down Holloway jail.<br />
She was a lady when she went in.<br />
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.<br />
</div>

Fair enough. Your lady is in jail and even though that basically 100%-izes the likelihood you're some flavor of dirtbag, it still gives you hell. Got it. Understood. Sucks. Sorry for you. But wuzzis:

<div class="lyrics">Frankie came home late from work one evening.<br />
The C.I.D. were hot on his trail.<br />
Frankie promised everything<br />
and then he went and turned her in.<br />
She went and took the rap for him.<br />
Now she's impaled in Holloway jail</div>

...Uh-huh, uh-huh. And who is "Frankie"? A spiv, is he? Not sure how to say this, mate, but it sounds like <em>Frankie's</em> baby is in Holloway Jail. Because "you" are nowhere to be found in this tale except in its telling, and your baby is living a hell because "she went and took the rap" for this dude. Hate the player, not the game?

# MAPPING IT
<span data-target="milleria" data-id="g.4" class="trigger">HM Prison Holloway, London</span>. Still standing, sounds like it's still a nightmare.
