<p>So as a dumb child -- often confused -- I confess I would stare in horror at this post's infamous image of a real, down-home lynching [1. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/23/AR2006032301420.html">Washington Post</a>] and ask nobody in particular as quietly as possible, "So...is that Hitler or not?"</p>
<p>I just wasn't super smart is all. Couldn't place Hitler in an historic, temporal, or spatial context. No biggie. But then imagine my terrific additional horror, years later (three weeks ago, in fact), when I learned that the event took place in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=40.5545&lon=-85.6577&zoom=12&layers=Q">Marion, Indiana</a>, a scant hour's drive from where I live now.</p>
<p>Done imaginging that? Well, now for a bonus round of shitting in your pants, realize that this lynching occurred in <em>fucking 1930</em>, and that ain't that long ago. Certainly not long ehough to be dismissed with that oh-well-we-all-did-crazy-things-back-in-the-day aw, shucksery that will sometimes explain why we used to beat kids and women and then drink, drink, drink and drive, drive, drive. Yeehaw, indeed.</p>
<p>New pants? Me, too. Btw I learned most of this when I picked up a copy of IU professor James H. Madison's <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/45957986">A Lynching in the Heartland: Race and Memory in America</a>, which isn't a great book I don't think but a decent social history. In it, Madison references the connection between that event in northern Indiana and the song "Strange Fruit" made famous by Billie Holiday. Please see Madison's book for more about the connection (or discussions of this important song at <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/strangefruit/film.html">PBS</a> or <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/strangefruit.shtml">BBC</a> or <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/record/nrpb/registry/nrpb-2002reg.html">LOC's National Recording Registry</a> or <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=33:3vfrxqe5ldde">AllMusic.com</a> or <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43723261">David Margolic's book</a>). All I'll say here is that the live version I'm posting (attached to Marion) is particularly gripping and dark and overwhelmed by the hopelessness of Holiday's knowing that such things had happened at all, let alone would -- oh, most certainly -- continue.<img class="pull-right" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/PH2006032301423.jpg" alt="" width="" height="" border="0" /></p>
<p>So it's Billie Holiday performing the legendary "Strange Fruit" in 1946 (from <em>Jazz at the Philharmonic Vol. I</em> released in 1994). Are you listening, current and future Indiana racists? Listen to Billie Holiday on this one, because she's got you fuck-ups nailed down.</p>
