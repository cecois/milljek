Remember that time when Bob Dylan shot a fire full of holes? Well he's not always super fun like that. In [The Ballad of Hollis Brown](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Si9u9FVlUTcUXVcawnstJ) he drops some bleak rurality on us:

<div class="lyrics">

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar
</div>

Ok, ok, it's easy to poke a shotgun into a stanza for some immediate backwoods cred. But to have "seven breezes blowing" around the door and then this punchline:


<div class="lyrics">

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born
</div>

...oof!

This first appeared on *[The Times They Are a-Changin'](https://open.spotify.com/album/7DZeLXvr9eTVpyI1OlqtcS)* in 1964, just after *[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan](https://open.spotify.com/album/0o1uFxZ1VTviqvNaYkTJek)* (1963 - ["Blowin' in the Wind"](https://open.spotify.com/track/18GiV1BaXzPVYpp9rmOg0E) and all that) and here's what happened[^1] at Columbia:
<div class="screenbox">
  <li class="character">Exec</li>
  <li class="dialogue">Bob, Bob, great stuff. *Great* stuff. Listen, the boys and I were wondering about the seven dead. Thinking maybe -- maybe that number could come down a little.</li>
  <li class="character">Dylan</li>
  <li class="action">[rambles on about a bunch of bullshit - truth and whatnot]</li>
  <li class="character">Exec</li>
  <li class="dialogue">Sure, sure, babe. We get that. It's cool. Of course. It's just...yeah, that's all cool, babe, but maybe it could go a little more like Blowin', whaddya think? Just a little more, uh, hopeful, you see?</li>
</div>

# MAPPING IT
  Although [Lyle Lofgren](http://www.lizlyle.lofgrens.org/LyleJour/HollisBrown.html) and [others](http://www.celestialmonochord.org/2006/03/hollis_browns_s.html) seem convinced (and are probably right) that the origin of the song could be traced to a true crime, nobody can find any evidence of it. So <span data-target="milleria" data-id="g.19" class="trigger">here it goes in rando rural South Dakota</span> - northeast cuz maybe news of a crime like this would have reached Hibbard that way.

# HEARING IT
So you're getting "The Ballad of Hollis Brown", but guess what: it's a Nina Simone performance (from 1966's *[Let it All Out](https://open.spotify.com/album/3vBx19MVX89jILEWWE4syK)*) instead of Dylan's. Why? Because Nina Simone is a kick-ass mama. Take it up with her.
