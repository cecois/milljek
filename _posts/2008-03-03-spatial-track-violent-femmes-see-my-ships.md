Wanna know everything that the Violent Femmes and Marvin Gaye have in common? You came to the right place, buster. Well, kinda. It's basically just this:

"See My Ships" (1988) is another in a pretty long line of creepfests sprung from under the disproportianately tall pompadour of a 1980s Gordon Gano. It's a not-entirely-cogent emo piece (not that those two very often conjoin), but the gist is that something ain't right at home - allusions to Jesus and "our lord" coming soon, Gabriel blowing his trumpet, Cain, the devil, and Marvin Gaye all amount to an uneasy–

Wait, Marvin Gaye? The dude who was shot and killed by his own father back in 1984? After kicking and beating the old man? In defense of the dad's rageful screaming and abuse of the mom? Following months and months of cocaine abuse? Coupled with spiraling depression? And, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FtkDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA96&ots=mcrDwq-Lad&dq=marvin%20gaye%20ebony%201985&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q=impotence&f=false">evidently</a>, emotionally cripping impotence? Just a few months after Marvin bought his dad a .38? That the dad used to shoot Marvin in the chest point blank? After repeated warnings that if Marvin ever laid a hand on his father he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FtkDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA96&ots=mcrDwq-Lad&dq=marvin%20gaye%20ebony%201985&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q=marvin%20gaye%20ebony%201985&f=false">would be murdered immediately</a>? And in his fancy maroon robe, no less?!

Checks out.

So enjoy, if at all possible, what is actually a pretty good, dirgy ode to familicide from golden-era Violent Femmes[^1] 

[^1]: Hm. What comes after "golden era"? Replace "golden era" with that.


# MAPPING IT
At <span data-target="milleria" data-id="g.9" class="trigger">2101 S. Gramercy Place</span>, a modest home where some ruff shiz went down (where "ruff shiz" is a euphemism for "extreme domestic violence).
