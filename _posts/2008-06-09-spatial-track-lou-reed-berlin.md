<!-- <p>I'm back from a conference in Germany (Potsdam) and as expected there were a number of kicking presentations about clever, ontologically-driven systems; lots of data portals that don't quite work yet; and long-winded domain scientists who basically hum the same tune they wrote years ago, but with the slightly arrogant clip of a practiced raconteur.</p>
<p>Potsdam was pastoral and charming, of course, and a quick bike tour of Berlin got us a little taste of that city's brutal beauty. So great trip, yes?</p>
<p>Great trip <em>no</em>! Because we couldn't get the fuck out of Berlin. Here's a list of notes from a 49-hour delay out of dearest Berliner Flughafen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tegen basically sorts people into various cages, all historic-like. If there's some issue – like a delay – you get to stand in line before you enter the cages. Do yourself a favor and don't think about it lest you end up standing in line, weeping.</li>
<li>Badgering airline personnel still doesn't work. Never did.</li>
<li>Airplane parts are evidently difficult to just find. Even at an airport.</li>
<li>A Holiday Inn is a Holiday Inn. It's green, it's mostly clean. It has soap. Anywhere you go.</li>
</ul>
<p>But yes, we biked around Berlin one afternoon to get the flavor of that famous city. And I can spare you the effort by posting Lou Reed's "Berlin," which somehow captured Berlin perfectly -- austere, rich, confusing, very adult, and beautifully sad. Overlooking that Lou Reed, lately, seems not unlike a droning geoscientist to assume everything he says is a gilded droll bomb, he should be commended, I guess, for somehow writing a little ballad that took on the flavor of its setting so well.</p>
<p>The track will go down on a little sidewalk café not far from Checkpoint Charlie, where the ambient sound of this song might be appropriate (or might have been, anyway).</p>

Manoman, how'd he do it? Lou Reed, he *nailed* Berlin with a sad, little ballad – austere, historically rich, confusing, very adult, and beautifully sad. The samples don't hurt toward this success, but still the rest of it's basically piano. And heartbreak. And resignation. And nostalgia. And the musical personification of the brutalism of Berlin, somehow? But "oh, honey, it was paradise."

# MAPPING IT
There's a little café <span data-target="milleria" data-id="g.12" class="trigger">not far from Checkpoint Charlie</span> that could easily be the place.
