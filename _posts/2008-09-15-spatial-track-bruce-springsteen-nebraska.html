So here we are already filching from entire <em>albums</em> named after places. So soon, we're out of ideas we have to slice up entire albums just to find a track to pin down?</p>
<p>
This week it's "Nebraska," by Bruce Springsteen from his album "Nebraska." What of it?! It's a dark tale about...about...erg, who cares? I guess some nihilistic dirtbag who -- and this is so sad -- had to <em>work</em> for a living and resented it? Plus his dirtbag girl-doll Caril Ann Fugate, described in a very pleasing understatement by <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/mass/starkweather/caril_3.html">TruTV as "not much of a scholar"?</a> Them?! Why not!</p>
<p>I'll tell you <em>why</em>: Nebraska holds up as a great exercise in style and career development. For The Boss. Those two wind-swept dopes don't deserve the acetate [1. I know we weren't still sticking with the acetate in 1982.] Springsteen &amp; Columbia (or whatever studio) used to immortalize them, but the record signaled a shift in Springsteen from anthemic rock bombast to, well, folk bombast. Progress! Question mark.</p>
<p>But the choice to wind the story of those two murdery clods through various acoustic prairie-scapes was a good one, allowing Springsteen to draw out arid, dark, scary, rural Nebraska song-scenes through arid, dark, scary, rural Nebraska goings-on.</p>
<p>That he wanted me to somehow care about how those drawling nudniks felt about the world or their impulses and impeti is Springsteen's problem. Surprise, I <em>don't</em>. Listening to the record itself, though, and this track, its microcosm, it's easy to find yourself lurking (innocently, ideally) in the black nights in which this terrible shit went down. And that's the point of mapping these songs after all.</p>
<p>So I'll attach "Nebraska" to 924 Belmont in Lincoln, NE (cited in <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/Jan/29/reporter-remember-cold-blooded-killer-charles-star/">this RockyMountainNews article</a> as the location of the murder of the Fugate family). Listen to it and imagine yourself out in an Oklahoma nighttime, whatever that might do for you.</p>
