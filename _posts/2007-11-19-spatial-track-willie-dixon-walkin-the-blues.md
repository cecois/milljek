<!-- <p>Oh, I remember now. The last track I posted, "Insane Asylum," was originally  going to be attached to Michigan Avenue in Chicago, because I recently found out that the old Chess Records studio is still there, still standing, and is in fact a <a href="http://www.saveamericastreasures.org/profiles/chess.htm">mostly-restored historic treasure</a>. But then I got carried away and attached it to my beloved Laredo, Tx, by virtue of the song's connection with "The Streets of Laredo." It's a whole tale and reaches way back to some rake in Ireland who got a touch of the sniffles from his lady love.[1. Sorry, that should read "contracted an STD due to excessively sketchy fucking."]</p>
<p>
	But already I digress! This time I really do want to talk about Chess Records, one of the billions of songs that was produced there, and how it matters that the company existed in a real, identifiable place. More specifically, almost all of the Chess recordings are of that period where the recordings sound like people who are in a room, playing.</p>
<p>That's all – the Chess recordings sound real and alive and you can hear it on tape.</p>
<p>Oh, had I led you to believe it was more convoluted or clever than that? It's not – there's something endlessly charming about hearing the room, about hearing ambient noise around a recording that lets you know you're dealing with actual badass muthafuckas who got together, sorted out what to do, and did it on-mic (and then slap-echoed the living hell out of it). Even when it's faked, if it sounds like you pulled a big gypsy troupe together in the same room and recorded it, you're leagues ahead with me (so long as it's not actually a big gypsy troupe). And recording imperfections (I'm talking to you, squeaky Bonham pedal)? You're a beauteous and alluring topic all your own and equally welcome.</p>
<p>So here comes a track from Chess records that sounds like it was recorded in a big room in that tiny Michigan Ave home. Unfortunately, that's about all it has going for it. Go get that great Willie Dixon box set if you want the actual good material, because this track is almost brain dead.</p>
<p>It's "Walkin' the Blues," and I suppose it's a nod to the way rock 'n' roll was starting to siphon the blues and get crazier and crazier. Or something? It's hard to tell, because while it's a not-terribly-enjoyable blues walk for most if its 3:00 runtime, it throws itself straight into the garbage right around the 2:43 mark when it becomes a mother-in-law joke and nothing more.</p> -->

Remember the "Insane Asylum" post? Five days ago? Originally that was going to be mapped to the old Chess Records studio in Chicago because it *sounds* like a Chess studios recording. Instead it had to go down where that unfortunate rake got a touch of the sniffles from his lady love.[^1]

But this week should really drop a pin on that little box on Michigan Ave, because so many of the recordings made there *sound* like they were made there, sound like they were made in a real, identifiable place. Almost all of the Chess recordings are of that period where the recordings sound like people who are in a room, playing, but Chess' in particular sound real and alive and you can hear it on tape cuz actual badass muthafuckas got together, sorted out what to do, and did it on-mic (and then slap-echoed the living hell out of it). Revisit Insane Asylum if you want a big, tall sound, but this one, "Walkin' the Blues," will suffice. Never mind that it feels like a bit of a throwaway, and never mind that right around the 2:43 mark it devolves even further into a dumb mother-in-law joke, but focus on the piano and bass throughout and you'll almost be able to *see* a couplea dudes in that little near-square in Chicago.

#### MAPPING IT
The definitive Chess location has to be the 2120 building. If for no other reason than its very address was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4KoBKbnRh4BywqvY5VPkts">ripped dafuk off</a> by -- surprise! -- bluesmen The Rolling Stones <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/78sLmeACzKnsCKz0dnWRHw">as well as by</a> –- well, whaddya know! -- George Thorogood. That little place in Chicago (technically one of several Chess locations) <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/210537820">still stands</a>.
