<p>Springsteen apologist, here. Even still.</p>
<p><em>Poor me a drink, Theresa, in one of those glasses you dust off<br />
And I'll watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross</em></p>
<p>Not bad, right? But "Working on a Dream"?! <em>Working on a Dream</em>. Really. You're <em>working on a dream</em>, are you, Bruce?</p>
<p>
But the title isn't the only dog on this album. It's "Queen of the Supermarket," which is an ode to some hapless slob at Bruce's local Wegeman's or whatev. This one tries very hard to push some tired sophomore up into the pantheon of Springsteen characters who dream so big they actually work up to takeoff speed and ride off into salvation. But this poor teen (she's a teenager, everybody!) is very likely just some surly local yap who misbags your clementines or chit-chats with Braden the produce stocker while your leeks wilt on the scale.</p>
<p>Even so it's Springsteen, so if anybody could pull it off, you know? Trouble is that he starts out in the hole:</p>
<p><em>There's a wonderful world where all you desire</p>
<p>	And everything you've longed for is at your fingertips</p>
<p>	Where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips</p>
<p>	Where aisles and aisles of dreams await you</p>
<p>	And the cool promise of ecstasy fills the air</p>
<p>	At the end of each working day she's waiting there.</em></p>
<p>
Hey, guess what! I don't even need to go on, do I. One stanza like that about a grocery store and we could just rap that gavel, yo. But before we go, here's an excerpt from a duet I heard he planned with that very same emette from Rumson High. Bruce goes...</p>
<div class="scrippet">
<p class="action">swelling music, E Street-style</p>
<p class="character">Bruce</p>
<p class="dialogue">
Guidance from the gods above <br />
At night I pray for the strength to tell her <br />
When I love I love I love I love her so <br />
Take my place in the check-out line <br />
For one moment her eyes meet mine <br />
I'm lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted up </p>
<p>Then the music gets a little choppy. Cuzzit's a young person, see.</p>
<p class="action">Beep. Thud. Thud. Beep. Then unaffectedly...</p>

You got your super saver card?</p>
</div>
<p>End of song. Maybe a sad trombone, maybe not.</p>
<p>And the bitch of it all is that it's actually called a "Super <em>Saver's</em> Card." [1. No I do not know if this is true. Plus I don't know what grocery store could possibly be this sublime, so I'm just dropping the whole post on Rumson, NJ.]</p>
