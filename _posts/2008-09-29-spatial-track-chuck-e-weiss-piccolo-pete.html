<p>Chuck E. Weiss seems the ultimate Los Angelino. Full of amusing bullshit, a raconteur, untrustworthy, a little seedy, fun, but ultimately superficial and soulless? Is that fair? I'm basing this charicature on Jay Leno. Fairer? But I swear it's perfectly appropriate in this track about a Ventura Boulevard antiques shop owner who disappears with his entire stock after "the cigarettes made him dead."</p>
<p>Unless you personally have some wistful reminiscence about an unhealthy antiques peddler bottled up inside of you, just aching for a shuffling honky tonk ballad to set free, this track may not catch you in the grip.[1. "The grip" is slang I just made up -- just now -- to mean that tainted plain between yr 1-hole and your 2-hole, presumably a solid purchase for something real like a monster or metaphorical like an emotion.] Also, this appears to have no connection (except possibly incidentally) with The Andrews Sisters' "Piccolo Pete," which was an exercise in...wasting studio time and acetate (or whatever medium they etched Andrews Sisters tracks into back then).</p>
<p>An <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/03/local/me-62089">article in the L.A. Times</a> from 1999 pretty well establishes the location of Piccolo Pete's, so that's where it goes.</p>
