<p>Great thief of African-American history Bob Dylan seems to have boosted the contrast on this story of a privileged, white douchebag and the barmaid he yelled to death in Baltimore's Emerson Hotel (this track's location) back in 1963. By many accounts, not least among them <a href="http://search.proquest.com/docview/213809260?accountid=12492">Ian Frazier's in <em>Mother Jones</em></a>, Dylan basically broke canes across the back of many of the facts in the story (oof, right?), coming down maybe an iota too hard on Zantzinger as though Zantzinger had bludgeoned the woman to death with a cane to the face.</p>
<p>But Zantzinger hadn't, evidently, and is merely responsible for basically terrorizing her into just, I guess, dying of her own accord. Point is, Dylan took liberties, Zantzinger was a prick, and old lady Carroll's 11 children were left to fend--</p>
<p>Wait a second. Eleven children?! Eleven, Ms. Carroll? Not, like, 9 or even 6? You needed 11 kids for some reason? I am dying to know: what <em>was</em> that reason? I know it happens still today -- people just load up on children like they'll need them for zombie fodder or something -- but I don't get how Hattie Carroll could even find time to fuck that much, let alone get maternal leave from The Emerson. What were you up to, Hattie Carroll? You were a seriously busy lady and I'd like to think you had an agenda in mind for that great population of yours.</p>
<p>Zantzinger, meanwhile, sounds like a tobacco-farming, socializing, plastic cane-collecting numbnuts, who not only fucked up one of the few rules people like him have lording over them (whatever you do, what<em>ever</em> you do, stop short of killing somebody) but left a legacy of fucking up in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/31/AR2006053100658.html">obvious and ironic ways</a>. Good work, genius. You smeared your stain across many decades and left little Zantzinger-sized holes in the Civil Rights movement that will last for years to come.</p>
<p>So there you have it.[1. Not really. Look closely to find that I've presented basically no real information.] And what have we learned in these four petite stanzas?</p>
<ol>
<li>William Zantzinger <em>did</em> kill poor Hattie Carroll, but...slightly more gently than you think.</li>
<li>Ms. Carroll was evidently planning to birth and field a Baltimore-based football team back when it was cool to have Baltimore-based football teams.</li>
<li>Dylan or no, sounds like there's no need to feel any sympathy for the besmirched name of William Zantzinger.</li>
<li>Bob Dylan loves black people so much he just wants to pinch their little cheeks and take their stuff.</li>
<li>Zantzinger, arguable public slander notwithstanding, is one of many who don't think Dylan is much of a singer.</li>
<li>Previous item is decidedly erroneous. Short of Tom Waits Dylan is perhaps the <em>best</em> singer.</li>
<li>John Ritter and Phil Hartman should still be alive and everyone knows it.</li>
