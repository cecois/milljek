Chuck E. Weiss seems the ultimate Los Angelino. Full of amusing bullshit; a raconteur; untrustworthy; a little seedy; fun, but ultimately superficial and soulless? Is that fair? It's all on display in this track about a Ventura Boulevard antiques shop owner who disappears – *with his entire stock* – after "the cigarettes made him dead." Anybody who has to preface a chorus by swearing on a quote from some random is 100% fulla shit. To wit:

<div class="lyrics">
He told me, and this I do swear
"Piccolo Pete's gone to Jesus.
He died in his Wakefield bed.
They say he's in antique heaven.
The cigarettes made him dead."
  </div>

Anyway, unless you personally have some wistful reminiscence about an unhealthy antiques peddler bottled up inside of you just aching for a shuffling kinda honky tonky ballad to set free, this track may not catch you in the grip. But Weiss is very ventura-boulevard-deco-antiques-dealer and so is this song.

# MAPPING IT
An <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1999/aug/03/local/me-62089">article in the L.A. Times</a> from 1999 pretty well establishes the location of Pete's at <span data-target="milleria" data-id="g.18" class="trigger">13814 Ventura Blvd.</span>
