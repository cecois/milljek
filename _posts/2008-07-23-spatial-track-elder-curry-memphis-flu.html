<p>The last track was a song about a prison fire that featured a ludicrous (albeit not terribly uncommon) melodramatic bridge. Full-tilt, eyes-in-the-lights acting in this one that makes Douglas Sirk look like Jim Jarmusch. So stilted and laughable, this thing was, that it completely zapped any empathy I might have had for those prisoners. Those dead, dead prisoners.</p>
<p>So I didn't want to turn this new track into a hackneyed stand-up routine (<em>'dja ever notice that white guys sing about disasters like this while black guys sing about disasters like like that?</em>), but I want to posit here even more evidence of why Whitey keeps lifting musical forms from African American cultures and subcultures. Without me to point it out, who would know, right? D'ja ever notice...?</p>
<p>The track is Elder Curry (and congregation, I presume) telling the story of the Memphis Flu. Some random internet people (<a href="http://www.csufresno.edu/folklore/ballads/RcMemFlu.html">Fresno State's Ballad Index</a>, <a href="http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/folk-song-lyrics/Influenza.htm">some "webmaster" named Rod</a>) suggest that Curry fucked up somehow and that he accidentally said "1929" when he meant "1918." Yes, there was some rough goings-on in 1918, but according to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/hist290a_0039.pdf">this CDC report</a> deaths also spiked a little in 1929 also. So let's go ahead and assume that Mr. Curry knew what he was talking about, eh?</p>
<p>Also? Who gives a shit, really? There are several things about this song that make it worth listening to. Primarily, Elder Curry et al know how to rock it. This is kick-ass gospel -- thanks at least to our friend on the piano but also the roomful of people who are able to keep up without some brick of a script in their hands like Bob Miller had -- and that's reason enough to want to throw down and play along. And there's other cool stuff, too, but -- play along with what, exacxtly? Well, unfortunately it's some crazy, spooked-out conjecture about how god is killing folks with the influenza. Rod has <a href="http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/folk-song-lyrics/Influenza.htm">the lyrics here</a> if you want to read along, but suffice it to say that god has evidently taken to dropping fuckers where they stand, rich or poor, because of all their sinning. Because this god character, every once in a while, suddenly cares about such things.</p>
<p>So anyway it's stupid and religious and it rocks. Ds get degrees, right? It's Elder Curry et al offering some awfully specious reasoning (specious at <em>best</em>!) for the influenza outbreak of 1929 in "Memphis Flu," again from <em>People Take Warning! Murder Ballads &amp; Songs of Disaster 1913-1938</em>. It's attached to Methodist University Hospital in Memphis, which no doubt saw their share of flu cases and provided beds to those poor dopes whose god up and decided to choke the life out of them. But there's an additional reason to put this in Memphis, as you're invited to put this song next to some Elvised-up rockabilly number from 20 years later and start thinking about whether some elderly (white) bearded ghosthead is really up there meting out justice for us animals. </p>
