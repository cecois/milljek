<p>You know the conceit behind these "Spatial Track" posts, right? The idea is to post something that is either informed or enriched by some connection to spatiality ("geography" to the uneducated) or is itself somehow evocative of, or at least ascribable to, some place. Hence posts that <a href="http://blog.milleria.org/spatial-track-bob-miller-ohio-prison-fire-2/">explicitly state their setting</a> or are otherwise <a href="http://blog.milleria.org/spatial-track-billie-holiday-strange-fruit/">heavy from the weight of their implicit location</a>.</p>
<p>But this post is different. This recording of Bill Haley's "Within this Broken Heart of Mine" is so explicitly spatial that it almost shouldn't even <em>count</em>. First of all, the song itself is entirely inconsequential, which is already trouble. But specifically the problem is that it's basically a recording of somebody giving directions. To a gig. Which is very quaint and all, but it kinda runs counter to the entire point of these posts.</p>
<p>How "counter" does it run? Not counter enough! So off we go with the long preamble to "Within this Broken Heart of Mine," before which Haley asks Billy Williamson, a member of backing band The Saddlemen, to provide directions to a gig at the Twin Bars in Gloucester, NJ. And Williamson does! For...<em>ever</em>! This bar is impossible to find, it turns out, and to imagine somebody listening to live radio in 1951, furiously scribbling several different iterations of terrible directions to a bar somewhere between Philadelphia and Gloucester, NJ, is to know exactly what was wrong with old timey types across the board.</p>
