<p>From a vigilante hanging in Indiana to the daylight murder of Medgar Evers in Mississippi, it's been a real clambake around here, lately. So this one's going to be the last of the depressing, racist killing posts for a while, k? It might even help if it's basically an alternate take on the Evers assassination. Oh, that doesn't help quell the pall of depression and anxiety you get from reading about black people who got too uppity and were stricken down in cold blood? Too bad, bc that's all I got to give.</p>
<p>This one is Bob Dylan's "Only a Pawn in Their Game," but the twist is that it's a performance from The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 ("Pawn" starts around 3:25). Never minding that it feels a little like that started out as two separate marches and then one was rain-checked and just folded into the other to consolidate water tables and catering and police overtime and P.A. equipment rentals, it's still pretty interesting to watch Dylan perform one of those old protesties for which he was so famous.</p>
<p>The verdict? Not that impressive! Through the prism of 21st-century middle class guilt, he looks like a white kid who isn't totally digging the opportunity to talk to thousands and thousands of politically-conscious African-Americans about the "poor white man" and "the negro's name." And the video's edit makes it seem that, in no uncertain terms, the crowd wasn't down with same.</p>
<p>But still the clip drips with atmosphere, so I'll place a copy (taken from "The Broadside Sessions: 1962-1963" bootleg) where it happened -- at The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. You're probably better off <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fffHzrtHhZM">watching it at YouTube</a>, but nonetheless the audio portion of "Pawn" is here for download, too.</p>
