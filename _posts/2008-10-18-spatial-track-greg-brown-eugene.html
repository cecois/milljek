<p>Greg, Greg. You like fishing and wandering. You like the woods. You like chatting with the dirtbags who litter the RVs that litter our national parks and the truck campers that litter our riversides. We get it. But "the blandification of our whole situation"? Really?! What's bland about our situation, then? That we <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/whatishiv.html" title="CDC - What is HIV/AIDS? - HIV Basics - HIV/AIDS">kinda sorta cured AIDS</a>? That we have <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" title="Apple - iPhone">super powerful computers in our pockets</a> that instantly connect us to the rest of the world? That we <a href="http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html" title="Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Home">build and send robots to Mars</a> and discover a bunch of Martian shit? </p>
<p>You'd rather we wander around telling tales to the moon, waiting for that dog to find us? Dunno, friend. You sound like a grouchy Luddite (read: confused). Why don't you take your Gibson JF45 and shove it up -- hey, that reminds me! How do you think those women who made your precious Gibson JF45 feel about all of this horrifying, normalizing, blandifying, icky progress? You think they do or don't like seeing their granddaughters grow up as bosses and executives and entrepreneurs and generally kickass ladies? RV owners, if you can imagine such a thing! Voting, and ~making their own decisions,~ and whatnot? As opposed to their own WWII-era options, which were "wife," "beaten wife," and "Gibson JF45 maker"?</p>
<p>But I'm sure it's great up there near Eugene, yes. Very solitary, very devoid of Verizon coverage. Best of luck calling 911 about your bear attack wounds, friend. Oh, wait, are there bears in Oregon? <em>Google, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=are+there+bears+in+oregon&amp;oq=are+there+bears+in+oregon&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.6269j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="are there bears in oregon - Google Search">are there bears in Oregon</a>?</em> (See?)</p>
