Remember the ["Insane Asylum" post](/spatialtrack/spatialtrack/2007/11/14/spatial-track-willie-dixon-koko-taylor-insane-asylum/)? Five days ago? Originally that was going to be mapped to the old Chess Records studio in Chicago because it *sounds* like a Chess studios recording. Instead it <span data-target="milleria" data-id="gD13" class="trigger">had to go down where</span> that unfortunate rake got a touch of the sniffles from his lady love.[^1]

But this week should really drop a pin on that little box on Michigan Ave, because so many of the recordings made there *sound* like they were made there, sound like they were made in a real, identifiable place. Almost all of the Chess recordings are of that period where the recordings sound like people who are in a room, playing, but Chess' in particular sound real and alive and you can hear it on tape cuz actual badass muthafuxkas got together, sorted out what to do, and did it on-mic (and then slap-echoed the living hell out of it). [Revisit Insane Asylum](/spatialtrack/spatialtrack/2007/11/14/spatial-track-willie-dixon-koko-taylor-insane-asylum/) if you want a big, tall sound, but this one, "Walkin' the Blues," will suffice. Never mind that it feels like a bit of a throwaway, and never mind that right around the 2:43 mark it devolves even further into a dumb mother-in-law joke, but focus on the piano and bass throughout and you'll almost be able to *see* a couplea dudes in that little near-square in Chicago.

[^1]: That should read "contracted an STD due to excessively sketchy fuxking."

# MAPPING IT
The definitive Chess location has to be <span data-target="milleria" data-id="gD14" class="trigger">the 2120 building</span>. If for no other reason than its very address was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4KoBKbnRh4BywqvY5VPkts">ripped dafuxk off</a> by -- surprise! -- blues legends The Rolling Stones <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/78sLmeACzKnsCKz0dnWRHw">as well as by</a> –- well, whaddya know! -- blues legend George Thorogood. That little place in Chicago (technically one of several Chess locations) <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/210537820">still stands</a>.
