Back in 1995 Steve Earle recorded "Ellis Unit One" for the <em>Dead Man Walking</em> soundtrack. "Ellis Unit One" refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Unit">O.B. Ellis Unit</a>, the <a href="http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_facts.html">Texas male death row from 1965 to 1999</a>. And it's really a good song. <em>Dead Man Walking</em> is famously about the death penalty, so Earle had to be like "Gotcha. Wun day-eth pyenuhlty folker cumin' raht up!" Oh, does he not sound exactly like that? Because he does.

And the song: let's see...is it unfair to say that if you locked every Bruce Springsteen song in a room and set them to fucking, this is what would ooze from under the door after a few hours? 

<div class="lyrics"><br />
I was fresh out of the service, it was back in '82<br />
I raised some Cain when I come back to town<br />
I left to be all I could be and come home without a clue<br />
And I married Dawn and had to settle down<br />
<br />
So I hired on at the prison<br />
Guess I always knew I would<br />
Just like my dad and both my uncles done<br />
<br />
And I worked on every cell block<br />
Now, and things're goin' good<br />
But then they transferred me to Ellis Unit One<br />
</div>

See? Anyway, when Milleria interviewed Steve Earle about the song (not true), it went something...like...this:

<strong>Milleria:</strong> <span class="anno">Steve, "Ellis Unit One" is a very stark and level song. Despite the "swing low" chorus and the notion that even Jesus "don't live on Ellis Unit One," there's a heavy inevitability that lays over the whole track that makes all of the different perspectives on execution basically point to the same, sad, end, and not some exalted romantic vision of the story. Did you intend something that was less political and more – what, <em>humanist</em>, perhaps – or did it just happen that way?</span>

<strong>Earle:</strong> <span class="anno">Well at the time I wrote "Ellis..." the state of Texas was torturing and executing dozens of people a year. That means every one of us was torturing and executing dozens of people a year, because when –</span>

<strong>Milleria:</strong> <span class="anno">I rescind the question! This interview is over!</span>

Anyway, it really is a good one.
