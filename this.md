title: About This

This thing used to be a [hosted WordPress](http://wordpress.com) instance. Then it became a WordPress instance [hosted on an OpenShift instance](http://openshift.redhat.com). Cool stories, bro? Well, if you're into this sort of thing, it kind of is a cool story now - everything wz yanked out of WP into a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) instance, which is (purposefully) very loosely coupled with a [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) + [Backbone](http://backbonejs.com) + [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) stack as basically an experiment in whether Jekyll could be given a highly JavaScripty mapping framework without disturbing its Jekyllness. Kinda works!

Its author (who makes himself sound like he's a tiny but successful think tank but is actually just some dude) has been an assistant professor in Texas and then an assistant/associate professor at a Big Ten school, specializing in spatial data organization, storage and delivery. He currently sits in the basement of a FFRDC (Federally-Funded Research and Development Center) in the Boston area – you know which one ;-) – where he works on a custom full-stack spatial data infrastructure.

VibrantJS is a separate project (unrelated to/NOT developed by Milleria) but we all get a kick out of it here around Milleria headquarters :-)
