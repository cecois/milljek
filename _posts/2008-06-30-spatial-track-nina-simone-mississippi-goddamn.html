<p>That last track (<a href="http://blog.milleria.org/spatial-track-billie-holiday-strange-fruit/">Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit,"</a>) was a sad, gloomy rumination on the inconceivable imagery of people (people!) being handled as so much dead flesh -- dripping from the trees from which they were hanged, to be perfectly blunt about it.</p>
<p>This time we get a little catharsis courtesy of Nina Simone, whose "Mississippi Goddamn" is much more forthright with its badass indictment of the shenanigans going in the 1960s. Oh, sorry, let "shenanigans" == the deflating murders of Medgar Evers in Jackson, MS, and four little kids (children, goddammit) in Birmingham, AL. "Mississippi Goddamn" is both a kickass song and performance. It will sound a little like something out of <em>Oklahoma!</em> (jaunty but almost brain-dead) but...it ain't. Over that 2/4 beat you'll hear a woman raging about the crazy shit going down in a country that was way too old for such things.</p>
<p>Anyway, part of its inspiration comes from the murder of Medgar Evers, who was shot down in his own yard in Jackson. I have not seen <em>Ghosts of Mississippi</em>, but if I had directed it I would have Scorcesed up that mutha by playing this Simone track over a procedural scene of Evers routinely driving home, disembarking his car with a box full of shirts, then being shot dead. The song is full of hot, sweaty, Mississippi anger, and by the end of its 5 minutes there's no mistaking it for some moon-eyed dose of garbage from Rodgers and/or Hammerstein.</p>
