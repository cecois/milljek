Let's try this for a while: periodically post some song that happens to have some implicit or explicit geospatial reference. No, more than that it is somehow colored and informed by its geospatial<em>ness</em>. It's <em>about</em> an identifiable earth location. Accompanying the track will be a shortish yap about it (past which you'll have to scroll in order to hear the track in question).

The first week is one of Tom Waits' best straight-up love songs, "Johnsburg, Illinois." This isn't Waits' best song ever (["Make it Rain"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3kiB7iiQkJRzHFO430V0p2) from <em>Real Gone</em> is, yo), but it's so sweet and earnest and unobscured by conundrums and bullhorns and whatnot that it's a bit of a surprise.

"Johnsburg, Illinois" is a spare, spare, romantic ballad. Straight up. No pretense, even. I don't even think it's ~exploring~ some potpourri of musical influence like a lotta these asshole musicians try to pull off when we're not looking. The song aggrandizes <span data-target="milleria" data-id="gD1" class="trigger">the town in which his wife, Kathleen Brennan, grew up</span>. The end. The place is [probably?] kinda ordinary and pedestrian -- you might notice Waits doesn't bother with a ton of, or any, detail about the joint -- but it gets a song because he loves this woman it produced. Waits actually says (according to Pieter Hartmans's 1983 interview posted at <a href="http://www.tomwaitslibrary.com/quotes-kathleen.html">TomWaitsLibrary.com</a> at least) that Brennan was raised up "by the Ching-a-Lings" on a farm that was situated "outside McHenry" near the Wisconsin border. Which is maybe less or more romantic than "You see I just can't live without her, and I'm her only boy," depending on taste, but still seems to be about the right sentiment.
