Springsteen apologists have plenty of material. Even in latter years:

<div class="lyrics">
Poor me a drink, Theresa, in one of those glasses you dust off
And I'll watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross
</div>

Not bad, right? But ["Working on a Dream"](https://open.spotify.com/album/5xJSVog0izeuIURO34C7Qa)?! *Working on a Dream*. Really. You're *working on a dream,* Bruce?

But the title isn't the only dog on this album. It's ["Queen of the Supermarket,"](https://open.spotify.com/track/3YYwcT63iArNkWtI8T9xDj) which is an ode to some hapless slob at Bruce's local Wegeman's or whatev. This one tries very hard to push some tired sophomore up into the pantheon of Springsteen characters who dream so big they actually work up to takeoff speed and ride off into salvation. But this poor teen (she's a teenager, y'all!) is very likely just some surly local yap who misbags your clementines or chit-chats with Braden the produce stocker while your leeks wilt on the scale.

Even so it's Springsteen, so if anybody could pull it off, ya know? Trouble is that he starts out in the hole:


<div class="lyrics">
There's a wonderful world where all you desire
And everything you've longed for is at your fingertips
Where the bittersweet taste of life is at your lips
Where aisles and aisles of dreams await you
And the cool promise of ecstasy fills the air
At the end of each working day she's waiting there.
</div>


Hey, guess what! We don't even need to go on. One stanza like that about a grocery store and we could just rap that gavel, yo. But before we go, here's an excerpt from a duet Bruce planned with that very same emette from Rumson High. Bruce goes...
<ul class="screenbox">
  <li class="action">swelling music, E Street-style</li>
  <li class="character">Bruce</li>
  <li class="dialogue">
<div class="lyrics">
Guidance from the gods above
At night I pray for the strength to tell her
When I love I love I love I love her so
Take my place in the check-out line
For one moment her eyes meet mine
I'm lifted up, lifted up, lifted up, lifted up
</div></li>
  <li class="action">rhythm gets choppy, middle-eight breaky</li>
  <li class="action">Beep. Thud. Thud. Beep. Then...</li>
  <li class="character">Girl [unaffectedly]</li>
  <li class="dialogue">
<div class="lyrics">Super saver card?</div>
</li>
</ul>

End of song. Maybe one of those hilarious sad trombones, maybe not. We never even find out if she was asking *for* a super saver card or offering one. Cuz who could possibly give a shit. Eesh.

# MAPPING IT
The Boss (surprisingly) never gets around to singing the street address of this Elysium so we gotta <span data-target="milleria" data-id="g.21" class="trigger"> choose an almost rando grocery store in Runson, NJ</span>.
