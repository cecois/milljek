Wikipedia [tells us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod_Kwassa_Kwassa) that 'In 2005, Vampire Weekend vocalist Ezra Koenig travelled through London en route to India and said that the trip got him "thinking a lot about colonialism and the aesthetic connections between preppy culture and the native cultures of places like Africa and India."'

...Which is ~so funny~ because Esmira -- the Pakistani who works her ass off at the Dunkin' Donuts from which my iPhone buys espresso lotsa mornings -- was saying the same thing about when *she* joyrid through all the Queen's properties and waxed poetic about the connections between preppy culture and a buncha terrible shit she saw! But that idiot forgot to lift a riff and publish a song with her band about it. [Sad trombone]

<div class="lyrics">
Drunk teenagers, let’s start a fight
Out getting wasted on a Saturday night
...
Imagine if that lake was beer
Imagine if that rock was hash
Some supernatural science class!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
</div>

It really sounds like it wz written by a drunk teenager, no? And while that's usually a hard pass, tnx, in this case it's certainly deliberate and fun(ish) and nostalgic and it works. The track sounds like a herd of thumps getting stoned out in the woods.

# MAPPING IT
The rock <span class="trigger" data-target="milleria" data-id="g.23">is legit</span>. But you gotta go to Canada to see it.
