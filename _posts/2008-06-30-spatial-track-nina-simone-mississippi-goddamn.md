<div class="lyrics">
This whole country is full of lies
You all gonna die and die like flies
I don't trust you anymore
You keep on sayin' "Go slow."

Oh, hello! That last track ([Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit,"](/spatialtrack/spatialtrack/2008/06/23/spatial-track-billie-holiday-strange-fruit/)) was a gloomy, black-as-night dirge about the inconceivable imagery of people (people!) being handled as so much dead flesh -- dripping from the trees from which they were hanged, to be perfectly blunt about it. This time it's the most badass Rodgers & Hammerstein you'll ever hear (because it is in no way a Rodgers & Hammerstein song). It's a very Nina Simone song, in fact - you can almost tell she wrote it *so that* she could perform it and *so that* the whiteys in the audience would be all "Ooh, honey [nudging], this is going to be fu – oh."

Anyway, part of its inspiration comes from the murder of Medgar Evers, who was shot down <span data-target="milleria" data-id="gD14" class="trigger">in his own yard in Jackson, MS</span>. The song is full of hot, sweaty, Mississippi anger, and by the end of its 5 minutes there's no mistaking it for some moon-eyed dose of garbage from those two *Oklahoma* jokers.


# MAPPING IT
It's in <span data-target="milleria" data-id="g.13" class="trigger">Mississippi</span>. The South.
