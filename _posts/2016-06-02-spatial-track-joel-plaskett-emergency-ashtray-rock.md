You know that thing where you get some skeevy old dude to buy you a case of Old Style Light and you drink it warm in the backseat of a car against a backdrop of dull, thudding Aerosmith and dull, thudding gravel and then you party in the woods with a bunch of world-class dopes, delivering tirades against sports and Aerosmith and just wishing, wishing, wishing somebody else would show up and then they don't or they do I don't remember but either way you end up puking into a hamper and wake up the next day ready to live out the rest of your days as an eventual complete failure? Evidently they do that in Canada, too. And Joel Plaskett kinda nailed it on 2007's *[Ashtray Rock](https://open.spotify.com/album/4DTUF7U4ZHYwjXRquYBxot)*. Actually, he mighta gone too far. Some lyrics;

<div class="lyrics">
Drunk teenagers, let’s start a fight
Out getting wasted on a Saturday night
...
Imagine if that lake was beer
Imagine if that rock was hash
Some supernatural science class!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
</div>

It really sounds like it wz written by a drunk teenager, no? And while that's usually a hard pass, tnx, in this case it's certainly deliberate and fun(ish) and nostalgic and it works. The track sounds like a herd of thumps getting stoned out in the woods.

# MAPPING IT
The rock <span class="trigger" data-target="milleria" data-id="g.23">is legit</span>. But you gotta go to Canada to see it.
