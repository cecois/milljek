<!-- <p><strong>CAVEAT:</strong> I could easily have grown up with the kind of backwoods anti-intellectualism that often disguises as humble, country charm but that tends to also cloister the ugly trappings of antiquated social, civil, and certainly racial segregationism. I grew up in a small town and saw plenty ugly business. It could have gone a different way, but by miracle of miracles I'm able to immediately know that anything described as "home-spun" is going to be viciously racist and homophobic. <em>However</em>: this week's track is positioned on, rooted in, born of, and in every way about a small town in Iowa called Audubon and a song that very much celebrates the sparse, simple, home-spun country-ness of rural places like it.</p>
<p>I quite frankly don't even know where to begin on this one. C.W. McCall is...well, he's...you see he doesn't really exist as such and...but he speaks cute, if simple, truths about trucking, environmentalism, and the joys (question mark) of rural living (primarily in Iowa and Colorado). I'm serious. Just look him up. But when you do, please look past "Convoy," McCall's big 1976 novelty hit, and if you're feeling generous look past the sad, racist follow-up, "'Round the World with the Rubber Duck." And while you're at it go ahead and look past Sam Peckinpah's 1978 film <em>Convoy</em>, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, Bill Fries (you'd know if you looked up McCall) was born in Audubon, just like the song says, and I'm attaching this song to that dusty hole in the corn. Never mind, I suppose, that another famous daughter of Audubon led a life that ended up not too far from Fries: Mary Arnold was a member of Kenny Rogers' First Edition and later married the late, great Roger Miller. But the business half of McCall (seriously, look him up) went on to become an environmental activist and mayor of Ouray, Colorado. His finest contribution to this culture, however, is his description in this song of Mavis Davis, erstwhile waitress at said Old Home Fill 'er Up and Keep on a'Truckin' Cafe:</p>

 <div class="lyrics">
 Now Mavis had all of her ducks in a row;<br/>
 weighed ninety-eight pounds, put on quite a show<br/>
 remind you of a couple of Cub Scouts trying to set up a Sears &amp; Roebuck pup tent<br/>
 There's no proposition that she couldn't handle<br/>
 Next to her nothing could hold a candle</br>
 Not a helluva lot upstairs but from there on down - Disneyland!
 </div>

<p>Don't deny that you can see it as clearly as you can see day. And while you're not denying your obviously delighted reaction, see if you can also not deny that that's maybe the best poem you've ever heard in your entire dumb life. Perhaps Shakespeare and Yeats can simply eat shit.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can go anywhere to have C.W. McCall explained to you. But Iowa is different - in order to appreciate "Audubon" you need to be able to imagine a town with one stoplight, one major cluster of grain silos in the one center of town, one main street, one Mexican family, and zero things better than any of that. It's in Iowa, which is not 100% cornfields and cornfield people -- there are pockets of culture and progressivism -- but it's not <em>not</em> a dusty methscape scattered with run-down farm implements and broken-down farmers. And the population that isn't racist farmers are just racist whatevers.</p>

<p>Aw c'mon, Iowa. Jokes. Except you can legit probably find people who "lost two fingers in a chainsaw" and there's legit nothing to do there except "go downtown and watch haircuts" and my town had a legit Squealer Feed Store *and* a restaurant called "The Feed Bag" until it burned to the ground. McCall knows his (their) shit.</p>


#### MAPPING IT
Audubon is actually in SW Iowa - considerably more Dust Bowl, considerably west of metros *Deez Moinz* and Iowa City. So if you want the definitive description of most of Iowa - here's "Audubon" by C.W. McCall:
