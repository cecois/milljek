Ugh, I had to consult a reference librarian for this track. Such effort! This guy, one Don Bonsteel, was super helpful and cordial and free. And he nailed the answer for me. Bonsteel works at <a href="http://www.prattlibrary.org/">Enoch Pratt Free Library/State Library Resource Center</a> in Baltimore, and he answered my question within a matter of hours when LexisNexis, Google, Cuil, Yahoo!, and about 50 other sources couldn't. And not for nothin'? I don't live anywhere near Baltimore, have never given anything to the Enoch Pratt Free library, have arguably never given anything back to this <em>world</em>, in fact. And yet here I am with free help from a kind librarian many hundreds of miles way. Thanks to Bonsteel and Enoch Pratt both.</p>
<p>And why? Because this Spatial Track post features the great David Byrne's "And She Was," taken from a show at London's Union Chapel</p>
<p>Byrne's intro gives away the location: it's a field near the Yoo-Hoo chocolate drink factory in Baltimore. But that was the thing that was so hard to find -- the location of that fucking factory in Baltimore. According to Bonsteel (according to the 1967 Baltimore Metro Telephone Directory), the factory was at 3500 Marmenco Court. So then I'm guessing at which field is features in the song itself, yes, but ultimately the location makes pretty good sense, since it's less than a mile east of Byrne's high school (Lansdowne).</p>
<p>So play the song and notice how easy it is to imagine yourself out in the dewy park grass, dreaming big into the light pollution of Baltimore industry. Or doing acid or whatever kids in Baltimore used to do. Yoo-hoo bombs, maybe.</p>
