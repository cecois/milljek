<p>You know what? I think you can find plenty of information about Charley Patton without my help. In particular the "High Water" tracks. You don't need a gloss from Whitey McPaleface from Iowa to make sense of the Father of the Delta Blues.</p>
<p>Or <em>do</em> you?! Recently it was my native Iowa that was mired in high water (but for real -- major flooding statewide), so maybe I know more than you think!</p>
<p>I don't. This new track comes, yet again, from the <em>People Take Warning!</em> volumes. It's "High Water Everywhere, Part 2" and I'm placing it in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=35.9315&lon=-89.8927&zoom=12&layers=M">Blytheville, AR</a>, even though it could feasibly be placed in any one of the locations Pattons mentions since the whole point is that there's nowhere the singer of this near-dirge could for shelter and refuge. Plus it's especially relevant to kin and brethren back in Iowa who are still digging shit -- <em>shit</em> for real -- out of living rooms and kitchens and restaurants (ok, yes, also trailers and shanties and rusted-out Bonnevilles). But how many of those really know Charley Patton's blues? Good question, right? It's one thing to stare down dejectedly at your jute chenille border from Pier1 soaking up a cocktail of Iowa River sludge and broken bottles of shiraz; it's another to be Charley Patton in early 20th century Arkansas.</p>
<p>How different is it? Imagine the tune sung by an Iowan neo-flood victim this year next to Patton. They're vastly different, yes? Then <em>that's</em> how different.</p>
