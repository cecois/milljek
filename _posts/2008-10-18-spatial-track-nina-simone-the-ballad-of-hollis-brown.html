<p>Remember that <em>one</em> time when Bob Dylan got intentionally obfuscational and impressionist and shot a fire full of holes? Well he's not always super fun like that. In "The Ballad of Hollis Brown" he drops some rural on us all:</p>
<p><em>There's seven breezes a-blowin' <br />
			All around the cabin door <br />
			There's seven breezes a-blowin' <br />
			All around the cabin door <br />
			Seven shots ring out <br />
			Like the ocean's pounding roar</em></p>
<p>Ok, ok, it's easy to drop a shotgun into a stanza for some immediate backwoods cred. But to have "seven breezes blowing" around the door? Actually poetic, Bob. And then comes the punchline. To wit:</p>
<p>
		<em>There's seven people dead <br />
				On a South Dakota farm <br />
				There's seven people dead <br />
				On a South Dakota farm <br />
				Somewhere in the distance <br />
				There's seven new people born</em></p>
<p>		...which <a href="http://www.celestialmonochord.org/2007/04/hollis_brown_re.html">Lyle Lofgren wrote</a> "is probably the coldest piece of poetry I've ever heard." (Nevermind that <em>ten</em> new people were probably born, but let's leave the looming spectre of overpopulation and fresh water shortages out of this.</p>
<p>This first appeared on <em>The Times They Are a-Changin'</em> in 1964, just after <em>The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</em> (1963 - "Blowin' in the Wind" and all) and I like to think of the Columbia Records exec hearing it and getting worried:</p>
<div class="scrippet">
<p class="character">Exec</p>
<p class="dialogue">Bob, Bob, great stuff. <em>Great</em> stuff. Listen, the boys and I were wondering about the seven dead. Thinking maybe -- maybe that number could come down a little.</p>
<p class="action">Dylan rambles on about a bunch of bullshit. Truth and whatnot</p>
<p class="character">Exec</p>
<p class="dialogue">Sure, sure, babe. I get that. We get that. It's cool. Of course. It's just...yeah, that's all cool, babe, but maybe it could go a little more like Blowin', whaddya think? Just a little more, uh, hopeful, you see?</p>
</div>
<p>So you're getting "The Ballad of Hollis Brown", but guess what: it's a Nina Simone performance (from 1966's <em>Let it All Out</em>) instead of Dylan's. Why? Because Nina Simone is a kick-ass mama. Take it up with her.</p>
<p>And although Lofgren and others seem convinced (and are probably right) that the origin of the song could be traced to a true crime, I'm putting this one down right where it says -- rural South Dakota.</p>
